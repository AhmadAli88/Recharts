### Tip: ResponsiveContainer Usage

The `ResponsiveContainer` component requires a parent element with a defined width and height to render properly. Make sure to set the width and height explicitly or ensure that the parent container has these properties.

Example:

```jsx
<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={400}>
  <LineChart data={data}>
    {/* Your chart components here */}
  </LineChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
